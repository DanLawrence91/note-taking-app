# Note Taker

## Description

This application is to be used to write and save notes using express js in the back end and to connect it to a front end using different routes.

## Installation

This application depends on express js and node js which will need to be installed. Once this has been done the repo can be cloned/forked to be ran.

## Usage

This project is to create notes and save them. Once the page is loaded you will see a home screen. If the button is pressed you will be redirected to another page where you will be able to add notes, delete notes and view saved notes. These are not saved to local storage but are saved to a JSON database file in the back end.

Notes will remain until deleted and can be viewed by clicking on a note to move it to the left hand part of the screen.

If the save button is pressed this will save the note and if the + button is pressed a new note are will appear to add a new note.
